There is a history of molar pregnancy, so need to do some more test also. Pregnancy is not a simple process.

Few deaths have also been reported. Presently if you have tightness in the chest associated with breathlessness it could be angina. As such angina is not a disease but is caused by low oxygen in the blood reaching the heart. However, angina can be indicative of some serious developing coronary artery disease. You can take sublingual Nitrogycerine when you feel tightness in the chest after consultation with your treating doctor. Do not neglect yourself, visit a cardiologist, get physically examined & get all screening tests done to rule out any CAD. The tests will include CBC, Urinalysis, lipid function tests, X-ray, ECG, Echocardiography, Stress tests & CT or MRI if required. Get treated.

The asian culture I grew up in was very demanding so I feel as if now that I'm on my own living and supporting myself without my parents completely...the things i experience are because of my past and i just am not consciously aware of it. My parents never told me they were proud of me and I was always not the best...I was never good enough for my parents even though in reality I was above average in school all the time. The past four years have been difficult and i have just recently moved out two months ago. My parents and I were able to try to mend things together and I got close and dependent on my parents and then they got mad and left me over and over...they never stayed the same. WHat I mean by leaving me...I mean disowning me...stop talking to me...etc. I'm in a wonderful relationship with a guy I will probably marry in the future. I want everything to be well, but I have concerns. My boyfriend is wonderful, but I get scared for no reason that I'm going to lose him. Sometimes because I'm afraid he will find someone better. I'm so insecure and I don't have any reason to be and I know that i don't have reasons to be but i am and I don't know why.

The Mirena IUD does not affect ovulation - you are still ovulating while it is in place.  The main way that this IUD works is by thickening cervical mucous and creating a barrier for sperm to get to the fallopian tube.  When the IUD has been in place for a long time, it might cause thinning of the uterine lining which can lead to breakthrough bleeding.  This can be prevented by putting you on a short course of progesterone or birth control pills.  The risks of pregnancy while on the Mirena IUD are extremely small.  They are not zero, however, and you should take a pregnancy test.I hope that this helps and good luck to you!Dr. Tim"}]}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

In NHL/lymphoma, can we get any clue from the change (decrease/increase) in the level of blood cells such as WBC and platelets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of lymphomas, which does not fall into the classification of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Anything which does not fit the criteria of Hodgkin's is NHL. NHL can be caused due to a viral infection like Epstein Barr Virus, radiation, immune-modifying drugs, etc. Any age group can be affected, but particularly above 50 years. Yes, it can occur even without any previous family history. No, it can rise in infections from surrounding areas or even another type of cancers. Virchow's node is one classically for gastric cancer metastasis to that node. Single lymph node, even if persistent is not a classical sign of lymphoma. Usually increase in size, multiple lymph nodes involvement and at 2 or more sites like axillae, femoral, etc. Single site, single lymph node which is persistent, is usually due to chronic inflammation. Due to chronic inflammation over a long time, intra-lymph node fibrosis (just like scar tissue) must have formed, which would not allow it to reduce in size. So, it will remain the same size. If there is no change in size, then nothing to worry about. Cancer particularly NHL can reduce immunity and increase the possibility of infection and hence fever. Also, in cancers, increased metabolism occurs, which can result in increased metabolic rate and hence sweating or fever can be seen. Night sweats particularly indicate cancer/ NHL. Usually, some symptoms will be found. Depends on the location, the involvement of other areas and the stage symptoms can vary. This way, all cancers start small and are not detectable, even by best methods. Internal lymph nodes require radiological investigation like CT, ultrasound etc for evaluation. Based on symptoms, if any, it can be evaluated. If doubtful, get a lymph node biopsy of the Virchow's node to confirm. You can find spleen and liver enlargement by radiological investigations or deep palpation. Stomach requires a definite ultrasound. A cough is not a classical symptom of NHL and usually, in lymphomas, bloods levels are not affected."}]}

Thirdly, you have been tested so far and it has all been negative. Leukemia does carry a family history but you can get your blood checked every six months. One thing you need to understand is, there are no medications as such which can you take which can prevent autoimmune diseases. If it has to happen, it would or else not. But yes, stress would definitely make things worse. So I would suggest just take it easy since you have had negative tests and enjoy your life. Keep a regular health check.

Precum contains some sperms which are capable of causing pregnancy. However, in your case, since within two days after intercourse, you have got your menses, there is no possibility of pregnancy for two reasons.:1. The egg release is 14 days before the menses; while you had intercourse two days before the sex. Hence there was no egg present to get fertilized.2. You have got the menses 2 days after the sex proving that you are not pregnant. So dear, please remove the concern of pregnancy from your mind and enjoy your life. To avoid such stressful situations in future I would advise you to use reliable contraception method like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"}]}

I can understand your every concern related to your baby. Usually all infants produce lot of gas and strains, grunts, turns their face to red while passing stool and it is absolutely normal. Their stool texture will be continuously changing, so unless there is very hard pellets like stools or blood tinged stool, there is nothing to worry. I had the same experience with my baby. It is hard to see your new born baby turning red, crying , grunting, straining while passing stool but this will remain only few weeks. What has helped me during those days are - Giving tummy massage or exercise 3 -4 times/ day and while passing gas or stool, burping after every feed.Even Colicaid didn't work for my baby. Giving 2.5 ml of gripe water has helped sometimes. Don't worry, as far as your baby is gaining weight, passing urine and stool frequently. Continue exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, that increases baby's immunity and also reduces the chance of constipation and diarrhea. Good luck."}]}

Regarding your short history, it seems that you may be having a gingival abscess or pericoronitis (if the last erupting tooth is involved). However, the picture of the lesion would have made things clear as to which site is involved and the state of the tooth involved (if it is carious or not). Still, it seems that you are having an infection and the lymph nodes are involved which relates the lump on the left side. The sore on the gum may be an aphthous ulcer or sinus opening as both are white, but sinus opening might be somewhat eruptive (nodule like). The sore throat is due to the infectious condition. So I think it might be a gingival abscess. The treatment requires a regime of antibiotics, analgesics and mouth wash. You can take Amoxycillin 500 mg and Clavulanic acid 125 mg two times (BD) for five days. Ibugesic acid (Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) 400 mg twice daily for five days and Chlorhexidine mouth wash thrice daily for two weeks. IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) to related tooth.

All these drugs are usually not recommended for a long time because of possible addiction and tolerance. I agree with you that this drug is not so addictive like other drugs, but it can lead to a low grade of addiction. That is why they have adviced you to stop the drug. But, you should know that drugs are not the only way to reduce muscle spasms. Physiotherapy is the most appropriate treatment for the long term treatment of muscle spasms. So, I would recommend considering to switch from this drug to physiotherapy. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"}]}

I turned 50 this year. It is impacting my ability yo exercise, so thought it was time to investigate. I just had a cardiac catheterization test. No blockages were discovered. However, they were not able to complete the procedure through wrist because my right side artery does not connect directly to the heart. It connects to the left side artery, which then goes to the heart or aortic arch. Stress test results showed abnormalities at high heart rate (both in EKG and echo).

First, you need to be started on medicines called as diuretics like Torsemide 10 mg once a day in the morning and also Amlodipine should be replaced with Beta blockers like Metoprolol XR 25 mg once a day. Both drugs will help you in relief of symptoms and also other benefits. So, you discuss with your local doctor regarding this. The symptoms occur due to pulmonary congestion. Both hypertension and your anomaly have a role in it. The next important decision will be of surgery to correct the abnormal connection. I need to know the details of the reports to know the exact type of anomaly and course of the artery. You can upload your angiography report. It is being the rare condition, the decision is not very straight forward, and data is inconclusive regarding the preferred modalities. In some conditions, patients are offered surgical management while in others patients are kept on drugs. It also depends on the opinion and willingness to undergo such major surgery. I think, you should be put on the drugs which I mentioned above and look for the response. For further information consult a cardiologist online -->"}]}

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

She vomits about twice a day. She consulted an ENT and internal medicine doctor. ENT dismissed her after nothing found in throat using a camera but the internal medicine doctor did some investigations. Results showed UTI (epithelial cells 20-25/HPF and pus cells 30-35) and TSH (13.5) raised as well as Candida Albicans growth from a throat swab. She has had this issue every few months and normally clears up on its own, but this time it is very severe and not going away.

No improvements are seen with many antibiotics. Oral thrush candida was found on initial appointments and also candida in throat swab. Is there any harm in trying a course of Fluconazole?

You may use tablet AF (Fluconazole) 150 mg once a day for one week. But in case of old age, people may feel nausea or vomiting for this drug then you can give iv Fluconazole (Forcan 100 ml) once a day for five days. In old age, vitamin B12 deficiency is also common, so it may present like glossitis with pharyngitis. Take vitamin B12 injection weekly once. You can give Neurobion injection also. Use Candid B mouth paint for local application. Use tablet Levosulfuride 25 mg twice a day for nausea and vomiting. At the same time check for serum electrolytes levels which may be altered in old age lead to vomiting. You may give probiotics like capsule Gut ok or Sporulac sachets to increase the immunity levels and also prevent gut growth of fungus. Remaining medications you continue the same. Response to the treatment may take four to five days. Diabetic patients are more prone to oral candidiasis so check for blood sugar."}]}

In July 2004, i had a work related injury where i went air born off a flight of stairs! To which it caused me to come crashing down on the stairs, hitting my back in two(2) places before coming too a stop! I landed on the 3rd stair 1st,  hitting my right butt check(2-3inches from my tail bone)damaging my S.nerve, which my upper body flung right back causing me to take another stair right under my right shoulder blade! I didnt break one bone, i was just badly bruised so i thought and so did my employer! I was put on modified hours until there was medical proof that something was diffently wrong in my lower/upper back! I had a MRI in March 2005 then i seen a Neuro surguan on May11 2005, for him too tell me that i need surgury&his reasoning for do it!! So i sat their by myself for a few minutes too take this all in and i had too make a big dession at that time all by myself  it was hard to do! But i ended up signing the papers to go ahead & proceed with the surgury, when i asked the doctor when l would be going to have surgury he said maybe in two months or so as he could not give me a date at the time of my appointment!! I then STOOD UP said thank you too the Doctor and that i will see him when the day comes for me to have surgury or before if need be!! The Doctor said yes to my last comment that is when i knew my appointment was done so i WALKED OUT of his office&went home. I stopped work fully on May 13 2005, by my family Doctor until i had my surgury on my back, I woke up on May 27 shortly after 7a.m.but how my body was feeling at the time!my mind then told me that i was still sleeping&that i was just dreaming!!!!YA RIGHT, i was DREAMING!!!!As they say,\"DREAMS DO COME TRUE\", l woke up fully when i went too roll over in my bed and only my upper body from the waist up seemed to beable too move or have any feeling it!! I layed myself back down on to my back and pulled the blankets off myself,with my left hand side being on the edge of the bed(me being LH)i quitley i hit myself in my left leg and felt nothing! Now l am fully awake&starting too get alittle scared, i would like too say that i am sorry for what l am about to say too you, as l get alittle bit embrassed talking about it!! Well here l go i layed back down &put my hand into my p.j.bottoms to grab my privates felt nothing, i also grab a handful of hair&pulled up and felt nothing except for my hair against the palm of my hand from holding on to my privates at the time!!! Then i took one of my hands(can\"t remember at his time which one i used)! I was able to get my hand partly under one of my butt cheeks to discover by feeling my p.j.\"S(with my hand)they were wet, i pinched myself& felt nothing!! I then pulled myself up on the bed to put me into a sitting position on the bed, and i as was doing this my pj bottoms just happened to came off in the prossess of me trying too sit up on the bed!! Now that l am sitting up l reached forward to grab my pajamies,Before i was able to look at my pj\"s fully, i was 50% sure that the wetness that i felt the 1st time with my hand is that i had a accident in my sleep(I PISSED MYSELF)!! Oh boy was i right about that but to my surprise i had also lost control of my bowels through-out the night as well!!!! I was going to get out of bed to clean myself up&the bed but my legs would not swing out of the bed, i would have to lift my legs out of the bed myself if i wanted to get up and out of the bed! I started to scream,cry&yell for help! l was taken to the hospitial where i had my C4 and C6 both removed &replaced with surgical metal and their is a small hole in my thoraic spine from T5-T11.i was walking after the surgury 2005 up until recently.At this time i am unable to walk without using any assitance to get around,i am not able to walk up or down stairs,i can not stand still without losing my balance,trouble lifting my legs/feet up high enough to get into/out of the tub or when i am trying to walk!! On Feb 6th 2013 my girl friend and myself were in a car accident to which we were rearend while we were in a complete stop, i had my seatbeat on& i was slightly leaning forward at the time. Not soon after that my lower back&S.nerve started to act up, i was going to physcio but i stopped going and got my own tens machine for at home(drive in the car is too long for me to sit)!! On May 15th 2013 i had a Dr.\"s appointment to which i WALKED into on my own 2 feet with no one help from no one or any kind of walking aid!!!! Besides being a normal monthly Doctor's app.i felt normal as usual, except i knew that i had a nasel infection the week before, i called to ask for something to be called in for me to the pharmacy(a antibiotic)and l also told him that my lower back& my S-nerve were causing me alot of pain when i try too walk or try and do a flight of stairs!!!! In order for me to go up a flight of stairs(hand free)&the safest is on my hand&knees(can't raise my legs/ feet that high enough) or weight bare on it at all even using the handrail  to try and get up very PAINFUL for me too do!!! The only way l came make it down the stairs in one piece is come down on my bum one stair at a time! Then just 2 days later after the doctors i woke up one day to where l could not walk without having assitance what so ever,stand up straight,weight bearing what so ever,feels like tremours thoughout my body at the time,i go into spasems if i stay in the same postion for a period of time without moving!

But as you had an accident leading to breakage of the front teeth, Root canal treatment followed by placement of three unit bridge was correct decision. If natural teeth were protruded, then while making bridge this alignment can slightly be improved by adjusting the placement of the bridge. But this carries physiological limits with it. If the bridge is in the place properly, then never think that it will let the underneath teeth to protrude more than present. This is because bridge itself is an obstruction for teeth movement. But still movement can occur only if the abutment teeth are peridontically weak or patient presents with poor oral hygiene. Keep your cleaning habits proper. Visit your dentist regularly for clinical examination so that any slight movement can be anticipated & treated immediately. Take care."}]}

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

A little over a month ago.I. had sex with a friend of mine that was staying with me from out of town. Have known the girl for a while. It was unprotected. Then on may 20th. I had unprotected sex with another friend at her bday party.again have known the girl for years. A few weeks later I was having diaherra and was a little tired. I had also recently started a new job and was working a lot of hours, for sometime 6 or 7 days in a row. Like a dumbass I went online to start researching and came across HIV.

On on my leg.one on my inner thigh opposite leg.and one on my chest..it was like a shot gun blast to the gut...lesions? I rushed to the ER..where the dr told me they were bug bites.

Places/on my body..I'm gonna take another test in a few weeks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Short answer: No choice but to wait and retestLong answer:Hi there,From your query, I gather that you are worried more about whether you have contracted HIV from your two unprotected encounters, than you are about the various symptoms that you have described.  However, since you have mentioned it, I will provide some simple solutions.  The bug bites can be managed with a simple hydrocortisone cream to bring down the swelling and discomfort.  Acne is common in areas you mentioned, and is usually managed with topical creams like benzoyl peroxide.  If you are unsure as to whether there is a swelling in your armpit, you should show it to your regular doctor, as it could be a sign of other infections.Regarding the HIV per se, as you may have learned, HIV seroconversion is very vague and non-specific, and we usually do not proceed with extra steps other than to caution you on avoiding further sexual contact while waiting for the testing.  You should be pretty safe if your HIV test was done at least a month after your last encounter.  Be sure to repeat one last test 3 months from your last exposure risk to ensure the accuracy of even the oldest testing methods.I would advise you to refrain from any sexual encounters until the final test, and stress the need for responsible safe sex in the future.  There are many other sexually transmitted diseases that you need to protect yourself from, like the far more common chlamydia and gonorrhea.Hope this helps.

I have seen the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your mother has pose a danger on the left side of the brain in a very critical area. The most common cause of this bleed is high blood pressure. In such a situation, patients take a long time to recover. The fact that the bleed is on the left side puts her at high risk of residual disability such as speech disturbance, memory disturbance even if she regains consciousness. The bleed is pretty bad and causing increased pressure within the skull which might pose danger to the remaining normal functioning brain. In such a situation, a decompressive craniotomy surgery may also be required. In the long term, she will take a long time to recover which can be up to six months.

She has been developing lot of moles on her body especially on hands and face. Initially they are very light almost like a small brown spot, but gradually they are becoming darker. They are incrementing periodically. What would be the reason for it? Is there any medication for it to stop and eradicate the issue? Thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. As you explained the disease that your wife has multiple small moles over face and hands, it certainly indicates solar lentigines. It is a multiple freckles type mole due to sun exposure. Now, let me explain the treatment and precautions. Avoid exposure to sunlight as much as you can. Cover body with clothes and cap while going out. Use sunscreen over face and hand every four hourly till evening. This will prevent further development of disease. Now to treat existing lentigines we can opt for laser. Creams will not be of much helpful in this. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) will be very useful. You can consult a doctor around you for this laser. One or two sitting would be enough to remove it completely. There is no side effect. It could be costlier, but results are good."}]}

Please continue the Atarax syrup (Hydroxyzine) only if there is itching. You can repeat HH mite cream (Permethrin) if itching is significant. It has to be applied to the whole body below the neck. Avoid the head, face, neck, anal and vaginal areas. Also, avoid regions where the skin is scratched. Over the scratched regions, you can apply Flutivate (Topical Fluticasone). Clip the nails of the baby, before the application, as the eggs of the scabies mites are generally present in the nails, which might cause a reinfection. Apply at night, and wash properly the next morning. All the family members should undergo the same treatment, even if they do not have symptoms. All the bed sheets and pillow covers and clothes of the family members should be washed separately. Fresh bedsheets or pillow covers should be used the next morning. I suggest you use HH mite soap (Permethrin topical), till complete recovery after this application. Itching may continue even for a week or two after HH mite application. So, if you have already followed the above procedure during your previous application, you can just use soap for now and wait for recovery.

Being genetically determined doesn't mean one cannot do anything about it.So my recommendation is to start an exercise programme and meticulously follow it. It's a slow step in developing the body to desired shape and the most fruitful one. For exercising different group of lower limb muscle either start at home work out or join a gym.Exercise will not only help your lower torso but also help in shaping upper body and will redistribute fat.Healthy foods- Dietary intake is of utmost importance since fast foods can lead to central or abdominal fat deposition which may further hamper your state. Intake of proteins is desired by the body during strengthening to build up new tissues.Be confident of yourself and carry yourself with attitude. It's something that matters most and above all. don't judge yourself by the eyes of others.Try out these above tips and forget what the world thinks about you.

Since your symptoms are improving after drinking water and eating food, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related pain is more. But better to rule out heart diseases despite of normal blood pressure and heart rate because left sided chest pain is commonly seen in heart diseases. So get done ecg. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. GERD and gastritis are likely causes in your case. So avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and tension. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Take proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole on empty stomach. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Better to first rule out heart diseases by ecg. Hope I have solved your query.

This is more suggestive of a problem with hormonal effects. I would advise you first to get in consultation of a Gynecologist, to undergo clinical examination, ultrasonography and blood and urine tests. Diagnostic Laparoscopy can help for the diagnosis and treatment too. IF this is endometriosis or tuberculosis of the abdomen, you will need definitive surgery and medical treatment."}]}

Have you measured your blood pressure lately? A low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension could explain this clinical scenario. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a chest x ray and some blood lab tests :- complete blood count ( for chronic anemia or a chronic infection). - HbA1C (to identify the mean blood glucose values of the last 3 months)- fasting glucose- kidney and liver function tests - thyroid hormone levels ( a thyroid dysfunction could also mimic these symptoms)- cortisol plasma levels (to examine the adrenal gland function)- blood electrolytes- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). A head up tilt test may be necessary to confirm a possible orthostatic hypotension if suspicions are raised during the physical exam. Meanwhile I would advise you to take plenty of water and juices and a balanced diabetic diet.Hope to have been helpful!Best regards, Dr. Iliri"}]}

I also had problems with cognition and concentration.\u00a0The mild numbness I had in my hands after vaccination has spread, and I developed burning, lancinating pains in my arms and legs.\u00a0It is painful to even wear shoes. I feel electric shocks in my arms and legs, and heaviness in my arms and legs got worse.\u00a0I feel as if I have the flu every day, and all my muscles hurt. I am dizzy and light-headed. I have intermittent problems with numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, clumsiness in my right hand, trouble running, painful jerking of my right arm, and a low energy level.\u00a0Overwhelming exhaustion that rest does not improve. I also have short-term memory loss, difficulty with attention span, low-grade fever, and rapid heart rate. The shoulder pain inhibits my ability to do chores and to groom myself.\u00a0Afterward, I started to struggle with dressing and lifting my arm. The shoulder pain onset was gradual, and I have body aches, frequent muscle tension, severe muscle weakness, muscle spasms, and soreness across my shoulders. I feel less coordinated, and have pain under my left arm, severe frontal and parietal headaches, and nausea. I feel weak from shoulder to the\u00a0elbow of my vaccinated arm, sweats, chills, joint aches, and stiffness. There are some unusual pains down the sides of my fingers, and inconsistent tremor of my right hand greater than my left. I also have vertigo, abnormal involuntary movements, memory loss, weakness in my left arm and left leg, and an inability to exercise. I get very ill when I try to exercise. According to my doctor, molecular mimicry is a potential mechanism for these adverse events. In such cases, a vaccine specifically activates cross-reactive T cells or antibodies that initiate a process, which ultimately injures the host\u2019s nerve tissues.\u00a0My GP said it is to do with 'nerves' and he referred me to a neurologist.\u00a0The list of investigations that would prove worthwhile is deltoid muscle biopsy, plasma creatine kinase levels, MRI shoulder, EKG, nerve conduction studies, and brain perfusion scan.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Don't ignore your symptoms,specially when already have coronary artery disease."}]}

I went on a no redmeat diet a few months ago and started getting mouth ulcers. i looked it up and saw low iron is a cause so i stopped. i often get dizzy spells, random nosebleeds. I fall asleep in class even when i get a good nights sleep. is it possible i could be anemic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello and welcome to HCM, Inoredr to assess whether you have anemia or not, you need to get certain investigations done- red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, red cell indices and peripheral blood smears examination to know the degree of anemia and type of anemia. Once the type of anemia is known, the cause of anemia can be assessed and thus treatment can be planned. Mouth ulcers usually occur due to deficiency of vitamin B group. Dizziness is a non-specific symptoms and can occur due to a number of causes. Thanks and take care Dr shailja P Wahal"}]}

I feel my tonsils are doing more harm than good for me, should i get them removed? also what are the best home remedies for this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern.As a home remedy for tonsillitis, you should do gargles with warm salt water or with chlorhexidine & water in 1:3 dilution. They will not treat the viral infection but prevent super-added bacterial infection. You can also take lozenges available OTC. Also take plenty of water and warm liquids.  Take paracetamol with ibuprofen for pain relief, fever and inflammation.You can get your tonsils removed if you have recurrent tonsillitis. You have said that you had this problem 6 times in 5 months. Guidelines about tonsillectomy says that it can be done if tonsillitis occurs 7 times or more in a year or 5 times or more per year for 2 years consecutively or 3 times or more per year for 3 years consecutively. So, see whether you fall in these criteria or not. Tonsillectomy can also be done if tonsillitis is severe and affecting day to day life. Consult a good ENT surgeon for the same and decide further.Hope this will be helpful.Do ask if any more question.Thanks for using HCM. Take care."}]}

As per your query you have  recurring cyst in the buttock. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like bacteria or fungus located on the surface of the skin can cause a boil. Boils are quite common and are usually caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, the most common bacteria found on the skin. When the hair follicle is damaged by a scratch or other break in the skin, the bacteria is able to move deeper into the follicular tissues, causing an infection and resulting in a boil . If cyst is appearing again and again then there must be other underlying problem like low immunity and diabetic condition . I would suggest you to consult dermatologist for proper examination . Doctor may prescribe antibacterial like cephalexin , clindamycin or erythromycin , anti fungal like fluconazole or vitamin supplement to boost immunity . For now apply warm compresses and eat healthy diet . Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"}]}
